# 512-Parking-Services

Project proposal
 
This project will simulate parking and traffic flows on a university campus. We will use the Embry-Riddle campus parking lot layouts as a base. We will have configurable parking lots which include configurable lot sizes, shapes, locations relative to one another, and parking restrictions. 
Each zone will have individual parking spots with variable characteristics. We will make provisions for specialized parking spots such as those for government vehicles only, handicap spots, and EV charging stations. 
The flow of vehicles within and between parking zones will also be taken into account. 
We wish to include variable conditions that may affect the status of a parking lot such as weather, lot closures (partial or full), and zoning changes.
Vehicles and traffic flow from outside of the present institution WILL NOT be taken into account (Vehicles passing through, non-students/staff/Employees).

Project will use C++ and the SFML Library in the MinGW enviroment.
